Hi! I'm **No√© Eric De Santo**.

I recently graduated from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/) with a Master's in Computer Science.
I'm currently still employed there to continue working on [a mechanization of JavaScript regexes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11919), which was the topic of my Master's thesis.
<br>
I will however be starting a PhD at [Penn](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/) this fall.

I'm mostly interested in anything related to programming languages, with a focus on reasoning about programs; some examples are:
- Programming languages design;
- Type systems;
- Program verification techniques.
