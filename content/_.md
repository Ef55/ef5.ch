Hi! I'm **Noé Eric De Santo**.

I'm currently a computer science student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/) (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne).
My interests (and thus my study) mostly focus on programing languages; more precisely this includes:
- Programing methods and paradigms;
- Compilers (parsing, type systems, garbage collection,...);
- Program verification.
