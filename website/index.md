Hi! I'm **Noé Eric De Santo**.

I'm a PhD student at the [University of
Pennsylvania](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/) in Computer Science.
My two main centers of interest are _Programming Languages_ and _Software
Verification_.

I was previously at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/) where I obtained my
Master's degree in Computer Science (as well as my Bachelor's before that).
My thesis was on [mechanized semantics for JavaScript regexes](projects/warblre.html).
