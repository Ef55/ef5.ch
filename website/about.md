I'm currently a PhD candidate at the [University of
Pennsylvania](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/) in Computer Science.
I was previously at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/) where I obtained
both my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science.

My two main centers of interest are

- <span class="hg1">Programming Languages</span>:
  Even though some people might see them as nothing more than tools, I see
  them as a fascinating subject of study.
  Some topics that I'm interested in are:
  - <span class="hg2">Compilers</span>, which have the delicate task of
    transforming code written for humans into efficient code meant for machines;
  - <span class="hg2">Type systems</span>, and how these can be used by
    programmers to express and communicate what their code is doing;
  - <span class="hg2">Semantics</span>, i.e. what do programs actually mean,
    which allow precise reasoning about code;
- and <span class="hg1">Software Verification</span>: how to make sure that
  software does exactly what we expect (and want) it to do? I'm particularly
  interested in applying this to my aforementioned other center of interest,
  i.e. verifying all of the code which is required to get a working
  programming language.
